# Datasets

Here we present the download and detailed preprocessing tutorial for the data we used in our training.


## Image Dataset for pretraining

Following the original paper, we use [ImageNet-1K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ILSVRC/imagenet-1k) to pretrain VQVAE-2D as the initialiation.

| Dataset | Train | Val |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ImageNet-1K | 1281167 | 50000 |

## Video Dataset

In this repositry, we use [UCF-101](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php) to train the VQVAE-3d.

We use the Train/Test Splits for Action Recognition, the statistics are:

| Dataset | Train | Test |
